## What I Did:
- Built a churn prediction model using XGBoosting to identify customers likely to cancel services.

- Optimized the model by tuning hyperparameters and evaluating performance (F1, ROC AUC).

- Explained predictions using SHAP to show which features (like tenure or contract type) drive churn.

## Skills Demonstrated:
✔ Machine Learning: Trained and compared classification models (LightGBM, XGBoost).
✔ Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features (e.g., High Risk flag).
✔ Model Interpretation: Used SHAP for explainable AI.
✔ Business Impact: Linked results to actionable insights (e.g., targeting high-risk customers).
