ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

Telecom companies face high customer attrition (churn), leading to revenue loss and increased acquisition costs. Predicting churn is challenging due to:
Complex customer behavior: Influenced by contract terms, service quality, and pricing.

Imbalanced data: Few churned customers compared to retained ones.

Multiple influencing factors: Tenure, payment methods, and add-on services.

Goal: Build a classification model to identify at-risk customers before they churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

ðŸŽ¯ Business Objective Reduce Churn Rate: Minimize customer attrition by targeting high-risk segments with personalized offers (e.g., discounts, upgraded plans).

Increase Revenue Retention: Save costs associated with acquiring new customers (5â€“10x more expensive than retention).

Improve Customer Experience: Use insights (e.g., low tenure + high monthly charges = high risk) to refine service offerings.

Success Metrics:

Reduction in churn rate by X% post-intervention.

Increase in customer lifetime value (CLTV) for retained customers.
